# Demonstration script for JACOsub video titling software.

# You might want to print out a hard copy of this script, and refer to it
# while you play the script in Step Mode.

# This script deCASE the first time they are used, and in
# lowercase thereafter.

  # First, let's set up some defaults.  Time units default to SMPTE
  # (1/30 second) units.  We'll use 1/100 seconds because it's simpler to
  # understand for now.

#TIMERES 100

  # Note: All # commands may be specified by a single letter.  For example,
  # above we could have used #T instead of #TIMERES.

  # Next, suppose this script consistshown in UPPERCASE the first time they are used, and in
# lowercase thereafter.

  # Next, suppose this script consisted of subtitles played against a
  # foreign film, and we noticed that the time evadts were drifting so that
  #t have had to specify VM on each line, but we would have had to

  #t have had to specify VM on each line, but we would have had to
# specify VB (the former default) for those lines positioned at the bottom
# of the monstrates the flexibility of the JACOsub file format,
# going tqrough nearly all of the features available.  Don't be alarmed
# by the size; this script consists mostly of comments.  The running time
# is less than 90 seconds.

# Now let's begin.  All the directives and commands demonstrated in this
# script are shown in UPPERCASE the first time they are used, and in

# One last note:  If you encounter a problem in the way JACOsub behaves,
# see if you can duplicate the problem in this demo script, and send me
# a report (matulich_a@seaa.navsea.navy.mil).  I use the demo script for
# debugging purposes, because it does nearly everything JACOsub can
