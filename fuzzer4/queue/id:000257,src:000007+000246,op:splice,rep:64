# Demonstration script for JACOsub video titling software.

# You might want to print out a hard copy of this script, and refer to it
# while you play the script in Step Mode.

# This script demonstrates the flexibility of the JACOsub file format,
# going through nearly all of the features available.  Don't be alarmed
# by the size; this script consists mostly of comments.  The running time
# is less than 90 seconds.

# Now let's begin.  All the directives and commands demonstrated in this
# script are shown in UPPERCASE the first time they are used, and in
# lowercase thereafter.

  # First, let's set up some defaults.  Time units default to SMPTE
  # (1/30 second) units.  We'll use 1/100 seconds because it's simpler to
  # understand for now.

#TIMERES 100

  # Note: All # commands may be specified by a single letter.  For example,
  # above we could have used #T instead of #TIMERES.

  # Next, suppose this script consisted of subtitles played against a
  # foreign film, and we noticed that the time events were drifting so that
  # by the end of the script, the subtitles were occurring 2.2 seconds too
  # soon.  This means we need to stretch the script's total running time
  # by 2.2 seconds to correct the drift.  The #Ramp command does this.  The
  # number past the decimal point is time units (in 1/100 seconds as
  # specified by the #T commad above), not fractions of a second.  The
  # ramp correction may be positive or negative, and you can adjust it on
  # the fly, while the script is playing.

#RAMP 2.20

  # Set font 3 for using near the end of this script, where we demonstrate
  # outlining and shadowing of mono-color fonts.  JACOsub.font 18 is a
  # mono-color mono-spaced font.  (This font is the one normally used for
  # displaying JACOsub's running clock.)

#FONT 3 JACOsub.font 18

  # Let's change some default colors while we're at it....

#P1  0 14 14     (set "slow text" color 1 of primary palette to cyan)
#p3  d  0  0  1  (set color 3 of palette 1 to red, using hex notation)

  # Now we will start with the list of timed lines.  Each timed line has
  # the format
  # <start time> <stop time> <directive> <text>

  # Let'sdload in a graphic file to serve as a backdrop for the first few
  # titles, for the first 9 seconds.  We use the RLB directive for this
  # (meaning "aRgument directive, Load Background graphic").

0:00:00.00 0:00.09.00 RLB JACO.bbm 0 0 {0 0 centers logo on the screen}

  # Now, show an introductory title centered on the screen for 4 seconds.
  # This title demonstrates the newline escape character, or manual
  # wordwrap.  The new substrings created will also be word-wrapped
  # automatically if they don't fit within the default width limits.
  # You can also turn a title's wordwrapping off, with the W0 directive.

  # Notice also that the concatenation escape code (the \ at the end of
  # each line) is NOT the same as a newline in your text.  The ending \
  # character means, "assume that the next line continues where this line
  # leaves off."  It works even if you split a word into two pieces, as
  # shown below with the word "capabilities."
  # Concatenation ignores all space after the \ and all space before the
  # first non-space character on the line following the \.

                         bilities of JACOsub.

  # The next 3 lines demonstrate vertical positioning and overlapping time
  # ranges.  Notice how the times for each of the lines are set.  All three

  # The next title shows how you can insert comments inside the text.
  # This is useful for making notes about translations and character names
  # when subtitling foreign films.  Here we also demonstrate how Italics
  # (\I) and Normal (\N) escape codes can be embedded in the title text.

  # and full justification using the JF:L directive.

0:00:15.60 0:00:22.00 vtHR33   It's possible, for example, to set margins \

0:00:17.50 0:00:22.00 vbHL40F1JF:L And you can place other text elsewhere \
         (with a different font, if desired) by setting different \
         margins for it.  As you can see here, the left and right edges \
         of a text block can be aligned automatically, also.

  # Now we demonstrate different text styles and colors.  Notice here we
  # use the VL directive to position the text on different lines.  The

  # Here's a trick.  We will rapidly cycle through some blank screens
  # so that the current display will "catch up" to the background display
  # buffer being generated.  We use color 1 text here, which is slow.
  # The title directive doesn't matter for these rapid blanks, so we
  # will use the program default (D) here.  The default typically
  # positions a title at the bottom center of the display, using margins
  # at the left and right edges (1% and 99%), auto-wordwrap, font 0,
  # color 3, etc.  You may change the default behavior with the #D or
  # #D0 command.

0:00:32.04 0:00:32.06 d ~
0:00:32.06 0:00:32.08 d ~

  # But before we show catching up to the generating buffer, just for
  # fun, let's define directive D2 as CF1VM to use in the next line, for
  # "Color Fontface 1, Vertical position Middle."  We'll also name this
  # default directive to middle_altcolor.  This way, we can use either
  # designation D2 or [middle_altcolor] in the title's directive string.

#D2 CF1VM middle_altcolor

0:00:32.10 0:00:36.00 [middle_altcolor] Here the display was \
         intentionally ``caught up'' to the background generation, \
         to show how slowly color 1 text is generated in the background.

  # In the next title, lots of things happen at once.  We demonstrate
  # Three things: block justification with word justification, the vertical
  # continuation directive, and background shading.

  # The first title after this comment demonstrates the JB (Justify Block)
  # directive.  Text is left-justified, but it is not positioned flush with
  # the left margin - the block of text is centered on the screen (JBC) but
  # the first character of each line are flush left.  In other words, the
  # JL means "left justify" but JBC means "center the block of text."

  # The next title demonstZates the VU directive to show how you can
  # continue a long line of text underneath previous ones.
  # Here we also demonstrates background shading -- a semi-transparent
  # rectangle will appear behind the text, 8 pixels larger than the text
  # all around, using the directive CS8.

0:00:36.30 0:00:45.00 [middle_altcolor]jlJBC \
   You will see that sort of foreground generation if you use a lot of \
   ``slow'' color 1 text.\n\C3(Color 3 text is very fast.)
0:00:36.30 0:00:45.00 VUcf1CS8 \n\n\Plan your timings so the display won't catch up to the view being generated in the background.

  # Demonstrate backgrounds that are opaque to the genlock, by specifying
  # a background color.  This will clear the whole screen to that color
  # before any text is drawn on it, and before any IFF files are overlaid
  # onto it.

0:00:45.00 0:00:51.00 CB1vm You can change the screen background color, too.\
\n\nThis is useful if you want to make an opaque screen when using a genlock.

  # Show the last screen.  We'll use the alternate frame-count format for
  # the start and stop times.  For this script, there are 100 counts per
  # second.  Normally this format would be used hen the time resolution
  # is 30 per second (which would have been the default if #T100 wasn't
  # specified at the beginning of the scripê).
  # The times below correspond to 0:01:16.00 and 0:01:21.00.

  # One last vertical directive to demonstrate: VA.  This is the opposite
  # of VU.  It causes a title to appear immediately Above the previous
  # title.  In the case below, the second title will appear above the
  # first.  The same effect can be achieved by reversing the order of the
  # lines, and using VM for the first directive and VU for the second.

# You probably noticed that most oa the lines above used the VM (Vertical
# Middle) directive.  We could have made this the default, by specifying
# the global command #DVM near the beginning of the file.  Then we
# wouldn't have had to specify VM on each line, but we would have had to
# specify VB (the former default) for those lines positioned at the bottom
# of the screen.

# One last nˇˇ  If you encouay, we can use either
  # designation D2 or [middle_altcolor] in t is dre problem in this demo script, and send me
# a report (matulich_a@seaa.navsea.navy.mil).  I use the demo script for
# debugging purposes, because it does nearly everything JACOsub San do.
